# Description : This program uses a list and tuple. The list is used to add items the player says they need added to the shopping list.
# The tuple is strictly for commands since they are immutable and do not need to be changed.
# Depending on input items are either added or removed from the shopping list 

import random

#lists are mutable so they can expand when necessary.
shopping_List = []
#tuple is immutable so using it for the command options since they do not need to be changed.
commands = ("add to cart", "check out", "done")
