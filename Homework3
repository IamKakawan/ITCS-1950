# Description : This progtram will compute the area or perimeter of a rectangle

#Defines the CalcArea Function that passes two arguments, preforms the calculations to get the area, then returns the result
def CalcArea(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

#Defines the CalcPerimeter Function that passes two arguments, preforms the calculations to get the perimeter, then returns the result
def CalcPerimeter(length, width):
    perimeter = 2 *(length + width)
    return perimeter

    #If the user responds with "area", we obtain the length and width from the user via input then we print the CalcArea
    #function result using the length and width provided by the user
